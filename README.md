Sharper Tooltips is a simple client-sided QOL mod that clarifies item tooltips based on their enchantments. This mod was
 created at the request of a user "Shadow" / "shadow.tech." on the official Fabric discord!

Currently, only the following enchantment is supported:
- **Sharpness**; adjusts the number displayed as "attack damage" to reflect the enchantment

Other enchantments are planned, however, such as protection. If you have any suggestions, including for modded
 enchantments, [please contact me at my discord](https://discord.gg/gYWwjRfNH7) or make a feature request on GitHub!
